# Recommendation-Using-NLP

How movie recommendation system works?

The movie recommendation system utilizes a combination of data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on their content similarity. Initially, it loads and cleans data from two datasets: one containing movie details and another with credits information. After merging and cleaning these datasets, it employs TF-IDF vectorization to transform textual overviews of movies into numerical representations. This step captures the importance of words and phrases in each movie's summary. Using the TF-IDF matrices, a sigmoid kernel function computes pairwise similarities between all movies, creating a similarity matrix. This matrix allows the system to find movies with similar content based on their overviews. A recommendation function then takes a movie title as input, retrieves its index, calculates similarity scores with other movies, and outputs the top 10 recommendations. This approach ensures that recommendations are personalized and relevant, leveraging content-based filtering to suggest movies that share thematic and narrative similarities with the user's chosen film.
